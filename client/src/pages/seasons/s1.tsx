            <h3>Welcome to Geesecraft!</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to our first ever season of Geesecraft!
            </p>
            <p>
                Things are simple here: Play Minecraft, fool around, and make sure to honk all day.
                It's peaceful around here, too! We have a beautiful park, some concrete houses, a semi-functioning economy, and much more.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules were lax... Maybe a little bit too lax.&nbsp;
                <span class="smol">(Stares at iiPython with his hundreds of double chests full of duped shulker boxes-).</span>&nbsp; 
                Regardless, we had a lot of fun in this season. Heck, we even invented the boat game in this season, where you splash weakness potions on yourself and knock boats like table tennis across the ice field.
                Apparently, iiPython sucks too much to ever out-compete DmmD. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

            <h3>Cool Archives!</h3>
            <p>
                Not much is left behind, unfortunately.
                We didn't do a very good job at archiving this season, well, because we didn't expect Geesecraft would go beyond Season 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless, enjoy this timelapse video that DmmD recorded on his YouTube channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                (Eventually... Since iiPython deleted his YouTube channel, the video is gone. I'll upload it to my YouTube channel when I feel like it. - DmmD)

            <h3>Goodbye Season 1!</h3>
            <p>
                Sadly, the world is lost forever as the hard drive containing all of the world data is destroyed due to an incident that happened around 2022.

                May the memories and our legacies live on in our hearts. o7
