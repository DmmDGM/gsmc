            <h3>Season 3! Season 3! SEASON 3!</h3>
            <p>
                Ah yes, Season 3.
                It's great to be back!
            </p>
            <p>
                This season started with DmmD and iiPython spawning in on an island in the middle of nowhere.
                There, the two began building a small town and establishing a sizable farm for food.
                It wasn't great, but it was enough to sustain a small group of friends.
                Over time, DmmD set up a small fish shop was set up to sell expired fish, iiPython made a beach-side hut, and emy made a giant ass wheat farm that is literally visible from the moon.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the season progressed, we also made a trading center to get enchantments and diamond gears.
                Continuing the trend of over-industralizing our server, we built a gunpowder farm for our elytras, a cobblestone farm because apparently we are always out of cobblestone?, a wither skeleton farm so we can flex, and much more.
                DmmD also tried to build his little house, except being lazy as he was, he never got to finish it.
                So there's always just this wooden frame in the middle of nowhere.

            <h3>Beating the Wither the Smart Way</h3>
            <p>
                Essentially, we just spawned like hundreds of iron golems and told them to go touch the wither.
                Then the wither was touched so hard that it willfully surrendered its nether star to us.
            </p>
            <p>
                We even got it on camera, look!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's just that easy to beat a wither.
                I really don't see why people say it's so difficult.
            </p>

            <h3>Nether Highway! WeeeEeeEEEEEEEE!!!1!!</h3>
            <p>
                We also built a nether highway to connect our home, trading center, automatic farms, and our iron farm.
                (Oh, did I mention we also built an insanely efficient iron farm?)
                Except since our nether spawn was in the basalt deltas, we kept having magma cubes issue.
                Of course, as geese, we don't solve problems with answers, we solve problems with even more problems!
                Our solution was to place carpets everywhere on the floor, which resulted in us frequently crashing into those one-pixel layers with our elytras.
                But, eh, what the heck.
                As long as it doesn't bother us, it's fine... Right?

            <h3>It's Getting a Little Bit Stale...</h3>
            <p>
                Well, the season's gotta end somewhere.
                Vanilla Minecraft really doesn't offer much once you have reached the end and defeated the ender dragon.
                We got pretty stacked with our diamond gears and farms.
            </p>
            <p>
                We did everything we could've imagined with our limited world.
                We built a mansion near the ocean, we got some axolotls, we even built conduit for some reason.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the bright side, this time, we actually did a good job archiving and backing up the world.
                Therefore, you can actually try to download the Minecraft world and explore everything that we have built on that Minecraft server.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, this concludes season 3 of Geesecraft.
