            <h3>It's Mods Time!</h3>
            <p>
                Season 4 is the first modded season in Geesecraft history with the introduction of Tech Reborn, Applied Energistics 2, and Ad Astra.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a fresh experience.
                After all, for the past 3 seasons, we have only been playing vanilla Minecraft with only minimal quality-of-life plugins at most.
                This time, we got internet with DmmD's ME Network, power with iiPython's generator in the basement, space colonization with rocket science, and McGeese - powered by corn.

            <h3>∞ Infinite UU Matter ∞</h3>
            <p>
                Tech Reborn has this "UU Matter" that you can use to craft literally most everything in Minecraft.
                Diamonds? Netherite? Your neighbor's dog? The Backrooms? UU Matter can make it all.
                Of course, being this overpowered, it is also expensive as hell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, we have "technology"!
                We just converted cobblestone from a cobblestone generator into infinite scraps, and with those scraps and a f- ton of power, we finally had the ability to produce infinite UU Matter!
                Finally, capitalism at work!

            <h3>End of Season 4.</h3>
            <p>
                I mean, we didn't lie when we said Geesecraft was supposed to be an annual event.
                It ran while we were on summer break, and now that school was about to start, the season's gotta end.
