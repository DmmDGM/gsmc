            <h3>More Mods! More Features! More Chaos!</h3>
            <p>
                New year, new Geesecraft, new mods!
                This time, we added a whole new array of mods, like Cobblemon, Hephaestus, Traveler's Backpack, Mine Cells, and Sculk Depths, just to name a few.

            <h3>The Basement Tech. Inc.</h3>
            <p>
                What's a Geesecraft without over-engineered industralization?
                That's why we didn't bother to build a house.
                Our basement IS our house!
            </p>
            <p>
                We got a huge chain of industral machines running deep down under our base manufacturing weird chemicals and chips to power our extremely hungry internet.
                Everywhere you look, you can see strange multi-block builds, high-voltage wires, and bronze water pipes running all across the room.
            </p>
            <p>
                Welp, that's the Geesecraft mindset for you.
                Need anything? Just build an entire automatic supply chain to make the automatic harvesting system to construct the automatic crafting system to automatically supply the item you requested on our internet.

            <h3>Pokemons Everywhere!</h3>
            <p>
                Since we added Cobblemon into our server, there were constantly creatures roaming around in our base, distracting us from work or blocking our paths.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's supposed to be a fun feature, but after the initial hype, no one seemed to be interested in catching and leveling up their pokemons.
                In the end, we started using those random pokemons as training dummies to test the stats of our weapons and armors.

            <h3>Farewell, Season 5!</h3>
            <p>
                Season 5 didn't have a dramatic ending like all previous other seasons.
                Every member on the server gradually started becoming too busy to log onto Geesecraft.
                It's unfortunate, but life's just that ruthless.
                With college beginning for iiPython and DmmD, this season marks the end of happy childhood and the start of real life struggles.
