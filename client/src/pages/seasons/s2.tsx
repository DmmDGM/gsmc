            <h3>Re:Geesecraft!</h3>
            <p>
                That moment when Geesecraft was so fun that we did it again.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time, we did something that we should've done last season: de-op'd everyone so there would be no more cheating.
                Shocking, I know, considering the whole premise of this server is to, well, survive!
                That's exactly why this season we established some basic "rules" to keep the server fun and fair for all: No cheating and no gacking (aka. hacking).
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, in this season, we added some plugins.
                We got EssentialsX so we can tpa to people to save travel time and set homes.
                We also got Gsit so we can ride on each other's heads... because why not.
                I mean, who can say no to free sla- I mean cheap transportation?

            <h3>Bigger Geese Pack!!!11!!1!</h3>
            <p>
                Our geese pack was way too small in season 1. That's why we made a bigger one!
                Just take a look at our gallery below.
            </p>
            <p>
                We even got a water fountain in the middle, with custom-built trees to decorate the sidewalks.
                We also built a horse stable for our <i>one</i> horse.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, there's also the classic ice boat game that we adapted and improved from season 1.
                It was kind of annoying to play sadly due to the strength effect from the beacon near by, making it impossible to play unless we temporarily disable the beacon.

            <h3>Villager Slavery!!!! YEAHHHH!</h3>
            <p>
                This was the first season that we experimented with a villager trading center.
                It was mediocre, but it got the job done.
                We got infinite golden carrots and enchantment books from those stupid big noses.
                (You have no idea how frustrating it was to transport all of those villagers from our villager breeding chamber to the trading hall. And don't even get me started on those god damn childr-.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Sorry. I think the previous editor got a little bit off track here.
                As we were saying, this was the first ever season that we tried to industralize our world.
                XP farms, shulker farms, tree farms, you name it!
                By the end of the season, we got everything we could've asked for.

            <h3>Sudden End to the Season...</h3>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, due to an incident that happened around 2022, the server hosting the server along with the hard drive containing data of both season 1 and season 2 were confiscated and most probably destroyed.
                Thus, we had to call an end to this season abruptly.
            </p>
            <p>
                But that's okay, because Geesecraft never dies!
                It wasn't too long before we were ready to start another season of Geesecraft next year.
            </p>
            <p>
                Goodbye, season 2. We will miss you.
